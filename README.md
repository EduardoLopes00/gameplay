# gameplay-NLW-PROJECT

This is a project built during an event of Rocketseat.
The app is about a plataform to find players and schedule a time to play online games
It has integration with Discord to facilitade the finding of friends.

Even though it was built in an event, I had a lot of chalenges to understand the project and made some improvmenets myself to fix some bugs that were left at the end.

Here's a post on my linkedin showing the project working(description in portuguese):
